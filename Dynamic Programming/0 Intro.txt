In recursion: 
1 always think of base condition.....things we can get on minimizing the input
2 write code for the choice diagram



3 ways to solve DP
1 Recursion
2 Momoization/ Bottom Up (Recursion + Table)....in memoization, matrix is formed from the parameters of the function which change every time
3 Top down (Only table)

To identify dp, ALWAYS:
1 choice 
2 optimal



Types of base problems
1 Knapsack
2 Longest common subsequence (LCS)
3 Matrix chain multiplication (MCM)


----------------------------------------------------

Knapsack types
1 0/1 : dp
2 unbounded: dp
3 fractional: GREEDY

KNAPSACK IDENTIFICATION: 
1 Always a weight array and some optimal(max/min) asked
2 We always have a choice to accept/reject the element.
3 T[n+1][W+1] ka matrix is formed...n is the size of array....W is the max weight/capacity of knapsack.

----------------------------------------------------

LCS INDENTIFICATION:
1 two strings given
2 asked for an optimal

----------------------------------------------------

MCM INDENTIFICATION:
1 we fix i and j first(j>=i)
2 then we need to iterate a variable K b/w the i and j
3 this will return a temp answer
4 we will calculate final ans using these returned values
5 there can be many variations to this
